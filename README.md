# Database

- [ ] Learn about good database design
- What is the actual difference between an ingredient, recipe, food, and meal?
  - meal
      - Has nutrient content
        - Fat
        - Carbs
        - Protein
      - Can be made up out of multi foods
      - can have a step plan pointing to multiple recipes to make the meal
  - recipe
    - steps to make it
    - Has nutrient content
      - Fat
      - Carbs
      - Protein
  - Food
    - can be made up out of 1 or more ingredients
    - Has nutrient content
    - Fat
      - Carbs
      - Protein
  - Ingredient
      - Has nutrient content
        - Fat
        - Carbs
        - Protein
  - user should be able to select any of these that they have consumed
      - and it should tally correctly to daily consumption of kcals, fats, carbs, and proteins

# ToDo

- todo MEDIUM PRIORITY top level component (pages and tabs) should override the stylesheet margin of a component's outermost JSX element. The most top level component should always handle margin to enforce consistency. Or should a component have its own margin or padding?. Margin is extra space outside border, padding is extra space inside border. I want all UI elements have the same distance from the edge of the screen. Currently that is done haphazardly, and isn't enforced consistently. I have to remember to set the right margin/padding. It is a pain. Is `useContext` a workable solution? Google solutions.
- todo HIGH PRIORITY DynamicTable does not render on my phone (Nokia g20 with Android 13). Database exists. So, I suspect the problem is with the component. I am using features that are not available on my android version? I do my testing on a simulator which runs Android 14.

# Bugs

- bug some tables are not updating when I food or consumed item is added? verify this
